### 🚀 90-Day Integrated Roadmap

#### *Phase 1: Cryptographic Foundations (Day 1-25)*
- [x] *Day 1-4:* Mastery of C++ Loops, Conditionals & Syntax (Lec 1-4).
- [ ] *Day 5:* Functional Decomposition: Designing Transaction Validation logic (Lec 5).
- [ ] *Day 6-10:* Bitwise Operators: Understanding the "Math" of SHA-256 (Lec 6-7).
- [ ] *Day 11-25:* Memory Control: Managing the Mempool using Pointers & Arrays.

#### *Phase 2: Identity & Interface (Day 26-50)*
- [ ] *Secure Strings:* Handling Wallet Addresses & Keys (Lec 29-33).
- [ ] *Qt Framework:* Designing the Dashboard with QML and C++ Signals.
- [ ] *Persistence:* Implementing SQLite to ensure the ledger survives a restart.

#### *Phase 3: The Execution Engine (Day 51-75)*
- [ ] *Blockchain Class:* Implementing a linked block structure (OOP).
- [ ] *Digital Signatures:* Integrating OpenSSL for Private Key signing.
- [ ] *Merkle Trees:* Efficiently verifying 1,000+ transactions (Lec 85-110).

#### *Phase 4: Networking & Final Audit (Day 76-90)*
- [ ] *P2P Layer:* Node discovery and data sync via QTcpSocket.
- [ ] *Multithreading:* Offloading "Mining" to background threads to keep UI fluid.
